public class AbstractMethod {

}





// which contain abstract methods as well as non abstract methods

// it has constructor
// still we cant create objects

// then why constructor is prest in abstract class??
// ANS;  Always we have to extend abstract class,
//      whenever we extend class,it always call parent class constructor, default constructor


//  If we cannot extend abstract class then we cannot make its object
// if we write any method we cant access it.
